## 1. `icon.png` — Plugin Logo

- **Size**: 128x128 px (or 256x256, will be scaled down)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background preferred
- **What**: The app icon/logo for Life Companion AI
- **How**:
  - Option A: Export from your design tool (Figma, Canva, etc.)
  - Option B: Use the Obsidian ribbon icon as base and enhance it
  - Option C: Generate with AI image tool (DALL-E, Midjourney) — prompt idea: "minimal flat icon for an AI life companion app, purple/violet theme, brain + chat bubble, transparent background"
- **Tips**: Keep it simple, recognizable at small sizes. Avoid text in the icon.

## 2. `hero.png` — Main Hero Screenshot

- **Size**: Full width, ideally 1200-1400px wide
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: The "money shot" — first thing users see, must look impressive
- **How**:
  1. Open Obsidian with your vault (use a clean, organized vault)
  2. Open Life Companion AI in the sidebar
  3. Have a conversation that shows the AI understanding your vault context
     - Example: Ask "What are my upcoming tasks this week?" or "Summarize my recent notes about [topic]"
  4. Make sure the response shows vault-aware content (not generic)
  5. Screenshot the full Obsidian window (Cmd+Shift+4, then Space, click window)
- **Tips**:
  - Use a clean Obsidian theme (default or minimal)
  - Have 2-3 messages in the chat (not empty, not too long)
  - Make sure the sidebar file list looks organized
  - Hide any personal/sensitive notes from the sidebar

## 3. `feature-chat.png` — AI Chat Feature

- **Size**: 800-1200px wide
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: A conversation showing the AI's vault-aware intelligence
- **How**:
  1. Start a new conversation
  2. Ask something specific about your notes, e.g.:
     - "What did I write about [project] last week?"
     - "Find my notes related to [topic] and summarize them"
  3. Wait for a detailed, context-rich response
  4. Screenshot just the chat panel (or the full window if it looks good)
- **Tips**:
  - The response should clearly show the AI knows your vault (mentions specific note names, dates, content)
  - Activity feed showing "Searching notes..." or "Reading note..." adds credibility
  - Avoid conversations with errors or generic responses

## 4. `feature-calendar.png` — Calendar Management

- **Size**: 800-1200px wide
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: The built-in calendar view with events
- **How**:
  1. Open the calendar view in the plugin
  2. Make sure there are a few events visible (create some test events if needed):
     - A one-time event (e.g., "Team meeting")
     - A recurring event (e.g., "Weekly review")
     - Events on different days to show the calendar populated
  3. Screenshot the calendar view
- **Tips**:
  - A month view with 3-5 events looks best (not empty, not cluttered)
  - If you can show the event creation dialog, that's a bonus
  - Use realistic event names (not "test event 1")

## 5. `feature-modes.png` — Quick & Deep Dive Modes

- **Size**: 800-1200px wide
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: Show the difference between Quick and Deep Dive modes
- **How**:
  - Option A (Recommended): Screenshot a Deep Dive response that shows:
    1. The mode selector showing "Deep Dive" selected
    2. The AI's thinking process (expandable thinking block)
    3. A thorough, multi-step response
  - Option B: Side-by-side comparison (Quick vs Deep Dive) — use any image editor to place them next to each other
- **Tips**:
  - Deep Dive with visible thinking process is the most impressive visual
  - Ask a complex question like "Analyze my productivity patterns this month" to trigger extended thinking
  - If using Claude, the thinking blocks are the most visually distinctive

## 6. `feature-vault-tools.png` — Vault Organization

- **Size**: 800-1200px wide
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: The AI performing actions on your vault with the activity feed visible
- **How**:
  1. Ask the AI to do something that triggers multiple tools:
     - "Create a new note called 'Project Ideas' in my Projects folder with a summary of my recent brainstorming notes"
     - "Find all tasks tagged #urgent and list them"
     - "Search my vault for notes about [topic] and add a tag to them"
  2. While the AI is working, you'll see the activity feed showing actions like:
     - "Searching notes..."
     - "Reading 'note-name.md'..."
     - "Creating note..."
  3. Screenshot while the activity feed is visible (or just after completion)
- **Tips**:
  - The activity feed is the key visual here — it shows transparency
  - 3-5 activity items looks best
  - The more "real" the task looks, the better

## 7. `feature-providers.png` — Multi-Provider Support

- **Size**: 600-800px wide (can be smaller, it's a UI element)
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: The model/provider selector dropdown
- **How**:
  1. Click the model selector in the toolbar
  2. The dropdown should show available providers:
     - Claude (Anthropic)
     - GPT-4 (OpenAI)
     - Gemini (Google)
     - Groq
  3. Screenshot the dropdown while it's open
- **Tips**:
  - Make sure at least 2-3 providers are configured so they show in the list
  - If you can show different model options under each provider, even better
  - A tight crop around the dropdown looks cleaner than full-screen

- **Size**: 800-1200px wide
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: Multiple conversation tabs open simultaneously
- **How**:

     - Tab 2: "Daily Reflection" (or personal topic)
     - Tab 3: "Quick Notes" (or anything else)
  2. Each tab should have some messages so it doesn't look empty
  3. Screenshot showing the tab bar with multiple tabs + the active conversation
- **Tips**:
  - Name your tabs/conversations with descriptive topics
  - 2-3 tabs is the sweet spot (not too few, not cluttered)
  - The active tab should have a visible conversation

- **What**: A conversation where the AI discusses an attached file
- **How**:
  1. Attach a file to the conversation:
     - A PDF (e.g., an article or document)
     - Or an image (e.g., a diagram, photo)
  2. Ask the AI about the file:
     - "Summarize this PDF"
     - "What's in this image?"
     - "Extract the key points from this document"
  3. Wait for the AI to respond with insights about the file
  4. Screenshot the conversation showing the attachment + AI response
- **Tips**:
  - The file preview/thumbnail should be visible in the chat
  - Use a non-sensitive file (avoid personal documents)
  - A PDF summary is usually the most impressive demo

## 10. `feature-bilingual.png` — Bilingual Support

- **Size**: 800-1200px wide
- **Format**: PNG
- **What**: The UI in Vietnamese to demonstrate bilingual support
- **How**:

  2. Start a conversation in Vietnamese:
     - "Tóm tắt các ghi chú gần đây của tôi"
     - "Tìm các công việc chưa hoàn thành"
  3. The AI should respond in Vietnamese
  4. The activity feed should also show Vietnamese descriptions
  5. Screenshot the conversation
- **Tips**:
  - Make sure both the UI labels AND the activity feed are in Vietnamese
  - This shows the bilingual feature is thorough, not just chat language
  - Switch back to English after taking the screenshot if needed

## General Screenshot Tips

1. **Window size**: Use a consistent window size for all screenshots (e.g., 1200x800)
2. **Theme**: Use the same Obsidian theme for all screenshots for visual consistency
3. **Clean up**: Hide sensitive notes, use realistic but non-personal data
4. **Retina**: If on Mac, screenshots will be 2x — this is fine, they'll look sharp on GitHub
5. **Crop**: Crop out unnecessary parts (menu bar, dock) unless showing full Obsidian window
6. **File size**: Keep each image under 500KB if possible (use TinyPNG to compress)
7. **Naming**: Use exact filenames listed above — the README already links to them
